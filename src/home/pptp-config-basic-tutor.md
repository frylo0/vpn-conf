# How to sutep PPTP server?

1. **Install PPTP Server (pptpd)**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pptpd
```

2. **Configure PPTP Server**:

Edit the PPTP server configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pptpd.conf
```

Example `/etc/pptpd.conf` content:

```plaintext
# Set the local IP address range for the VPN
localip 192.168.0.1
remoteip 192.168.0.100-200
```

In this example:
- `localip`: Specifies the local IP address of the VPN server.
- `remoteip`: Defines the range of IP addresses that will be assigned to VPN clients.

3. **Set up Authentication**:

Edit the chap-secrets file to add VPN users:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
```

Example `/etc/ppp/chap-secrets` content:

```plaintext
# Secrets for authentication using CHAP
# client    server  secret          IP addresses
username1   pptpd   password1       *
username2   pptpd   password2       *
```

Replace `username1`, `username2`, `password1`, `password2` with your desired credentials.

4. **Enable IP Forwarding**:

Edit the sysctl configuration to enable IP forwarding:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Uncomment the line `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`:

```plaintext
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

5. **Restart Services**:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart pptpd
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

6. **Configure Firewall**:

You may need to adjust your firewall settings to allow PPTP traffic. For example, using iptables:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1723 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p gre -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp+ -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
```

Save the iptables rules to persist across reboots.

7. **Testing**:

You should now be able to connect to your PPTP VPN server using configured credentials from a PPTP client. Test the connection to ensure everything is working as expected.

Remember, PPTP is considered insecure due to its weak encryption, and it's recommended to use more secure protocols like WireGuard or OpenVPN if possible. Additionally, always ensure that your server and VPN configuration are properly secured.
